# Stock-Price-Prediction-Using-RNN-LSTM-and-BiLSTM-Models


This project focuses on predicting the stock prices of AAPL (Apple Inc.) for August 2024 using different deep learning models: Simple RNN, LSTM, and BiLSTM. The models are trained on historical stock price data and evaluated based on their accuracy in predicting future prices. The effectiveness of each model is compared using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) to determine the best-performing architecture for stock price prediction.
